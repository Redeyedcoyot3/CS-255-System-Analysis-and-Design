# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design
# HI! This is my Readme file for the System Analysis Design course at Southern New Hampshire University.


# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    The DriverPass project aim was to assist customers in passing their Driver's license exams. It offered a range of course packages, allowing customers to select and pair them with licensed driving instructors who would provide the necessary training for passing exams. The DrivingPass program is designed to provide the tools, resources, and experience for customers to pass their Driving License exam while following guidelines set by the DMV. 
    The client of the DriverPass system include the boss (Liam) and the IT officer (Ian) who both outlined the requirements for the system. The type of system that they specified was primarily a cloud-based system that can be accessed both offline and online that enabled customers to make reservations for driving instructor lessons while also maintaining an online profile through the website. 

# What did you do particularly well?
    I feel I did particularily well in capturing the main use-cases and then also transitioning those into actual UML diagrams. The UML diagrams were helpful in capturing the various process and logical flows behind the use-cases of the program. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    One part of the work I would revise would be the presentation. I would have liked to include more detail behind the actual system itself instead of some of the front-end aspects of the requirements. Relying on cloud-based software is a complicated method of software design but also a necessary aspect of the project. 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The users needs were specifically outlined so there was not a lot of room for interpretation. Relying on the interview transcript was absolutely necessary for capturing all of the requirements but also thinking through how these requirements were going to be implemented helped in capturing requirements the client may not have detailed. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing a system because they are going to be the primary users of that system, so the interaction will need to be solely focused on their experience. This is a necessary aspect of most system designs, because how a user interacts with a system affects the design of the system itself. 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    Designing software is a complicated process but certain techniques and strategies like first capturing all of the necessary requirements to gain an idea of the main system functionalities is a start. After the main requirements are captured, then deciding how to represent the modeling behind the system is next, whether the system is going to be represented as a functional or object model can help in identifying the various components of a system. Identifying the various relationships behind each object utilized in a systems helps to gain an accurate sense of how the system will interact with itself and the user. Once the system's data model is effectively created, then the system can start to be programmed using various coding languages. In analyzing and designing a system it's important to keep in mind the various strategies necessary, like capturing requirememnts, identifying various componenents, the user-interaction, and the relationships between objects are all involved.
